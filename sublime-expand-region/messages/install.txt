Hi! And welcome to ExpandRegion for Sublime Text.


In order to make this plugin work you need to set a shortcut. 



***    By default no shortcut is set!    ***


I recommend using the shortcut for the build in "Expand Selection to Scope".
Open "Preferences" -> "Key Bindings - User" and add to following line:


{ "keys": ["super+shift+space"], "command": "expand_region" }
